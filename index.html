			<p> Hi, my name is Tyler Walker. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had a passion for technology, and I always was curious about it. I had my first computer when I was about 12 years old, and I never left it since. I grew a love for video games, and all things tech. I also like to follow financial news and keep an eye on the markets! That’s honestly all I really like doing. Playing video games, and watching the news.  </p>
			<br>
			<p> With my passion for tech, I never really thought I would ever be a programmer. I always thought that I wasn’t smart enough, but after taking an introductory programming course in college, I quickly learned how amazing it is. You have so much power, being able to create whatever you want. I always thought it was amazing how you can imagine something and just create it. The feeling of solving a problem is amazing. After graduating college with a double major in Business Economics and Political Science, I decided that I wanted to change career paths. Unfortunately, it was too late for me to change my mind so late in college when I discovered programming. Initially I wanted to move into finance, but I decided that being a web developer would be a much more fitting a fulfilling career for me.  </p>
